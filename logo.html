            <p>A WhatsApp Web clone is a web application designed to mimic the functionality of the popular WhatsApp messenger app on the web.
            It is one of those online web development projects where you will build a clone app allowing users to use WhatsApp on their laptops or desktops without installing any mobile 	    application. This application typically uses similar user interfaces and functionality to the official WhatsApp Web application using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and WebSockets for 	    real-time communication. It is a great project to showcase your web development skills as you will have to be careful in mimicking all features, integrating stickers and  	  	    emoticons, and facilitating voice and video calls.</p>
